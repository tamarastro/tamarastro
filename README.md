### Welcome to my tamarastro GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tamara Davis, a Professor of Astrophysics at the [University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/) in Brisbane, Australia. 

I study cosmology, so I'm trying to understand the universe as a whole -- how it began, how it will end, and everything in between.  In particular I'm interested in studying the dark side of the universe, all the things we cannot see or touch, like dark matter and dark energy.

## About me

I'm originally from Sydney and grew up on the beach near Coogee.  I did my undergrad at the University of New South Wales and the postdocs at the Australian National University and the University of Copenhagen (Denmark) before moving to the University of Queensland where I've been since 2009.
